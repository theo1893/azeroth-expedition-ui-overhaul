## 🎯 What's New in Version 7.6.1 (February 6, 2026)
- Added a new menu in /pfui named "Throttling" - Players who were unsatisfied with the throttling update rate can change it now for nameplates, Toolip Cursor and Chat Tab.

---

## 🎯 What's New in Version 7.6.0 (February 3, 2026)

### 🚀 Centralized Cast-Bar Tracking System (libdebuff.lua + nameplates.lua)

**Major architectural change: Cast tracking moved from nameplates to libdebuff for single source of truth!**

Previously, both `nameplates.lua` and `libdebuff.lua` independently tracked cast events, creating code duplication and maintenance overhead. Now all cast tracking is centralized in `libdebuff.lua` with nameplates consuming shared data.

**libdebuff.lua - NEW Cast Tracking:**
- ✅ `SPELL_START_SELF/OTHER` → Cast-Start Tracking
- ✅ `SPELL_GO_SELF/OTHER` → Cast-Completion Tracking  
- ✅ `SPELL_FAILED_OTHER` → Cast-Cancel Detection (movement, interrupts, OOM)
- ✅ `pfUI.libdebuff_casts` → Shared cast data structure `[casterGuid] = {spellID, spellName, icon, startTime, duration, endTime, event}`
- ✅ `pfUI.libdebuff_GetSpellIcon()` → Icon cache export function

**nameplates.lua - Simplified Cast Consumption:**
- ✅ `GetCastInfo(guid)` → Reads `pfUI.libdebuff_casts`
- ✅ `pfUI.libdebuff_GetSpellIcon` → Uses shared icon cache
- ❌ `UNIT_CASTEVENT` → **REMOVED** (replaced by Nampower SPELL_* events)
- ❌ Local cast tracking code → **REMOVED** (~56 lines saved)

**Benefits:**
- **100% Nampower, 0% SuperWOW** - No longer depends on UNIT_CASTEVENT
- **Single Source of Truth** - Cast data only tracked once
- **Icon Cache 100-400x faster** - First lookup via Nampower's GetSpellIconTexture, then cached
- **Easier Maintenance** - Changes only in one place
- **Code Reduction** - 56 lines removed from nameplates.lua

### ⚠️ Nampower Version Requirement Update (libdebuff.lua)

**Now requires Nampower 2.27.2+ (SPELL_FAILED_OTHER bug fix):**

Version 2.27.1 had a bug where `SPELL_FAILED_OTHER` didn't fire for movement-cancelled casts. This is now fixed in 2.27.2.

**User Warnings:**
- **2.27.2+**: ✅ Success message + auto-enable CVars
- **2.27.1**: ⚠️ Yellow warning + popup (cast-bar cancel broken)
- **< 2.27.1**: ❌ Red error + popup (debuff tracking disabled)
- **No Nampower**: ❌ Red error + popup (addon disabled)

**NEW StaticPopup Dialogs:**

Popups appear center-screen on login to ensure users don't miss the version requirement!

### 🌿 libpredict HoT Tracking Integration (libpredict.lua)

**Major enhancement: libdebuff integration for server-accurate HoT tracking!**

Previously, libpredict relied purely on prediction (UNIT_CASTEVENT + timing calculations). Now it uses libdebuff's AURA_CAST events for server-side accurate buff/debuff data when available.

**NEW Hybrid System:**
```
GetHotDuration(unit, spell):
  1. Try libdebuff first (Nampower AURA_CAST events)
     ↓
     if available: return server-accurate data
  
  2. Fallback to prediction (legacy system)
     ↓
     Use hots[] table with UNIT_CASTEVENT prediction
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Server-accurate durations** - No prediction needed with Nampower
- ✅ **Automatic rank protection** - Built into libdebuff's system
- ✅ **Multi-caster support** - Multiple druids = multiple rejuvs tracked separately
- ✅ **Zero overhead** - libdebuff already tracks all auras
- ✅ **Backwards compatible** - Falls back to prediction without Nampower

**NEW Rank Support for HoTs:**

Extended `Hot()` function signature to include rank parameter:
```lua
function libpredict:Hot(sender, target, spell, duration, startTime, source, rank)
```

**Rank Protection Logic:**
- Don't overwrite Rank 10 HoT with Rank 8!
- Active higher-rank HoTs block lower-rank applications
- Works with multiple casters simultaneously

**HealComm Protocol Extended (Backwards Compatible):**
- OLD: `"Reju/TargetName/15/"`
- NEW: `"Reju/TargetName/15/10/"` (rank added)
- `"0"` = unknown rank (for non-rank-aware clients)

**Example Scenario:**
```
Druid A casts Rejuvenation Rank 10 (15s duration)
Druid B casts Rejuvenation Rank 8  (12s duration)

With rank protection:
→ Rank 8 is BLOCKED while Rank 10 is active!
→ No more accidental overwrites of better HoTs!
```

### 📊 Code Statistics

- New: libdebuff integration, rank support, rank protection logic
- Backwards compatible: Works with/without Nampower

---

## 🎯 What's New in Version 7.5.1 (February 02, 2026)

- Added icon cache system - Icons are now cached in pfUI.libdebuff_icon_cache for instant lookups after first access

- Replaced SpellInfo texture lookups with GetSpellIconTexture - Direct DBC queries via Nampower (~100-400x faster than tooltip parsing)

- Optimized UnitDebuff() function - Now uses GetUnitField("aura") to retrieve spell IDs directly from unit data, then fetches icons via GetSpellIconTexture instead of vanilla UnitDebuff API

- Changed fallback icons - Unknown spell icons now display QuestionMark instead of class-specific icons

- Performance impact - Icon lookups reduced from ~5-20ms to ~0.05ms (first) / ~0.001ms (cached) per debuff, resulting in 600-2600x speedup for full debuff bars

- Replaced in libdebuff.lua the UNIT_CASTEVENT of Superwow with Nampowers SPELL_GO and SPELL_START events (slowly trying to get away from superwow, not maintained anymore and outdated)

---

## 🎯 What's New in Version 7.5.0 (January 31, 2026)

### 🔧 Player Buff Bar Timer Fix (buffwatch.lua)

**Fixed buff timers resetting on Player Buff/Debuff Bars when other buffs expire:**

Previously, buff bar timers would reset or jump when other buffs expired because the UUID (unique identifier) included the slot number. Since slots shift when buffs expire, the same buff would get a new UUID, causing the timer bar to think it's a new buff.

**The Problem:**
- Old UUID: `texture + name + slot` (e.g., "PowerWordFortitude_tex_PWF_3")
- Buff in slot 3 expires → slots 4,5,6 shift down to 3,4,5
- UUID changes from `..._4` to `..._3` → timer resets!

**The Solution:**
- Player buffs now use: `texture + name` only (no slot)
- Target debuffs still use: `texture + name + slot` (needed for multi-caster scenarios)

```lua
-- For player: no slot in uuid (slots shift when other buffs expire)
-- For target: include slot (multiple players can have same debuff)
local uuid
if frame.unit == "player" then
  uuid = data[4] .. data[3] -- texture + name only
else
  uuid = data[4] .. data[3] .. data[2] -- texture + name + slot
end
```

### 🛡️ Immunity Check for Debuff Timers (libdebuff.lua)

**No more phantom timers for immune targets:**

When a target is immune to your debuff (e.g., Rake bleed on a bleed-immune mob), the `AURA_CAST` event fires but `DEBUFF_ADDED` never comes. Previously this could create a timer with icon for a debuff that was never actually applied.

**The Fix:**
- Debuff data now requires `slot` to be set (confirmed by `DEBUFF_ADDED_OTHER` event)
- If `AURA_CAST` fires but `DEBUFF_ADDED` never comes → `slot` stays `nil` → no timer/icon shown

```lua
-- IMMUNITY CHECK: Only show if slot is set (confirmed by DEBUFF_ADDED_OTHER)
-- This prevents showing timers for spells like Rake where the bleed is immune
if data.slot and timeleft > -1 then
  -- Show the debuff
end
```

### 🎯 UnitDebuff() Now Returns Caster Information (libdebuff.lua)

**Enhanced UnitDebuff() API - 8th return value is now `caster`:**

```lua
local name, rank, texture, stacks, dtype, duration, timeleft, caster = libdebuff:UnitDebuff(unit, id)
-- caster = "player" (your debuff), "other" (someone else's), or nil (unknown)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Buff bar tooltip can now find correct slot for "only own debuffs" mode
- UI can differentiate between your debuffs and others' debuffs
- Enables future features like "show only my debuffs" filters

### 🔄 Buff Bar Tooltip Fix for "Only Own Debuffs" Mode (buffwatch.lua)

**Fixed tooltip showing wrong debuff in "only own debuffs" mode:**

When using the "Show only own debuffs" option on Target Debuff Bars, hovering over a debuff could show the wrong tooltip because the displayed slot didn't match the actual game slot. Now searches through all game slots to find the correct one by matching spell name AND caster.

### 🔧 Lua 5.0 Local Variable Limit Workaround (libdebuff.lua)

**Fixed addon failing to load due to Lua 5.0's 32 local variable limit:**

Lua 5.0 (used by WoW 1.12) has a hard limit of 32 local variables per function scope. As libdebuff grew, it hit this limit and stopped loading entirely.

**The Solution:** Moved 11 tables from local scope to `pfUI.` namespace:

| Old (local) | New (pfUI. namespace) |
|-------------|----------------------|
| `ownDebuffs` | `pfUI.libdebuff_own` |
| `ownSlots` | `pfUI.libdebuff_own_slots` |
| `allSlots` | `pfUI.libdebuff_all_slots` |
| `allAuraCasts` | `pfUI.libdebuff_all_auras` |
| `pendingCasts` | `pfUI.libdebuff_pending` |
| `objectsByGuid` | `pfUI.libdebuff_objects_guid` |
| `debugStats` | `pfUI.libdebuff_debugstats` |
| `lastCastRanks` | `pfUI.libdebuff_lastranks` |
| `lastFailedSpells` | `pfUI.libdebuff_lastfailed` |
| `lastUnitDebuffLog` | `pfUI.libdebuff_lastlog` |
| `cache` | `pfUI.libdebuff_cache` |

### 🛑 Crash 132 Fix (Credits: jrc13245)

**Fixed client crash (Error 132) when logging out:**

WoW crashes with Error 132 when addons make API calls like `UnitExists()` during shutdown, especially with UnitXP DLL installed.

**The Fix:** Register `PLAYER_LOGOUT` event and immediately disable all event handling:

```lua
frame:RegisterEvent("PLAYER_LOGOUT")
frame:SetScript("OnEvent", function()
  if event == "PLAYER_LOGOUT" then
    this:UnregisterAllEvents()
    this:SetScript("OnEvent", nil)
    return
  end
  -- ... rest of event handling
end)
```

**Applied to:**
- `libdebuff.lua` - All event frames
- `nameplates.lua` - nameplates + nameplates.combat frames
- `nampower.lua` - Spell queue indicator frame
- `superwow.lua` - Secondary mana bar frames
- `actionbar.lua` - Page switch frame

### ⚡ Performance Micro-Optimizations

**Various small performance improvements across the codebase:**

| Optimization | Location | Benefit |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `childs` table reuse | nameplates.lua | Avoids creating new table every scan cycle |
| Indexed access instead of `pairs()` | nameplates.lua | Faster debuff timeout scanning |
| Quick exit if not in combat | nameplates.lua | Skips threatcolor calculation when unnecessary |
| Player GUID caching | libdebuff.lua | Avoids repeated `UnitExists("player")` calls |
| Consistent DoNothing() pattern | unitframes.lua, nameplates.lua | Lightweight frames when animation disabled |

### 📋 Complete libdebuff.lua Feature Summary

For reference, here's everything the enhanced libdebuff system now provides:

**Debuff Detection:**
- ✅ Checks for dodges, misses, resists, parries, immunes, reflects, and evades
- ✅ Immunity check - no timer if debuff wasn't actually applied
- ✅ Tracks if debuff is from YOU or from OTHERS (including their GUID)

**Rank & Duration:**
- ✅ Rank protection - lower rank spells can't refresh higher rank timers

- ✅ Handles dispels and removals via events

**API:**
- ✅ `UnitDebuff()` returns: name, rank, texture, stacks, dtype, duration, timeleft, caster
- ✅ `UnitOwnDebuff()` for filtering only your own debuffs
- ✅ Cleveroids API compatibility via `objectsByGuid`

**Debug Commands:**
- `/shifttest start/stop/stats/slots` - Debug debuff slot tracking
- `/memcheck` - Show memory usage statistics

## 🎯 What's New in Version 7.4.3 (January 29, 2026)

### ⚡ Massive Performance Optimization - Cooldown Frame Overhaul

**Revolutionary frame creation system that eliminates unnecessary Model frames:**

Previously, pfUI created expensive Model frames for every single buff/debuff cooldown timer, even when the animation was disabled. This caused significant performance overhead, especially in 40-man raids where hundreds of frames were created but never actually used.

**The Problem:**
- Old system: **ALWAYS** created Model frames with `CooldownFrameTemplate`
- When animation was disabled, frames were just hidden with `SetAlpha(0)`
- The frames still existed and consumed CPU resources in the background
- In raids: 40 players × 32 buffs/debuffs = **1,280 Model frames** running even when animations were off!

**The Solution (Nameplates.lua + Unitframes.lua):**
- New system: Creates **Frame type based on config setting**
- Animation ON → Model frame with `CooldownFrameTemplate` (expensive but animated)
- Animation OFF → Regular Frame with dummy functions (lightweight, no animation)
- Dummy functions (`DoNothing()`) prevent crashes when `CooldownFrame_SetTimer()` is called

**Performance Impact:**

| Scenario | Before 7.4.3 | After 7.4.3 | Improvement |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Player frame (animation ON) | 32 Model frames | 32 Model frames | No change ✅ |
| 40 raid frames (animation OFF) | 1,280 Model frames | 1,280 Light frames | **100% lighter!** 🚀 |
| Mixed (player ON, raid OFF) | 1,312 Model frames | 32 Model + 1,280 Light | **98% less Model frames!** 🎯 |

**Real-World Example:**
```
Before: ALL frames = 1,312 expensive Model frames
After:  32 Model (player) + 1,280 Light (raid) = 98% reduction in overhead
```

**Technical Implementation:**

```lua
-- Nameplates.lua & Unitframes.lua
if cooldown_anim == 1 then
  -- Create expensive Model frame
  cd = CreateFrame("Model", ...)
else
  -- Create lightweight Frame
  cd = CreateFrame("Frame", ...)
  cd.AdvanceTime = DoNothing
  cd.SetSequence = DoNothing
  cd.SetSequenceTime = DoNothing
end
```

**User Experience:**
- ✅ **GUI Integration:** Toggling "Show Timer Animation" now prompts for `/reload`
- ✅ **Per-Frame Control:** Each unitframe type (player/target/raid/party) has independent settings
- ✅ **Immediate Effect:** Reload applies the correct frame type based on your config
- ✅ **No Visual Change:** When animation is ON, everything looks identical (just way more efficient!)

**Why This Matters:**
- **40-man raids:** Dramatically reduced frame update overhead
- **Low-end PCs:** Smoother gameplay with animations disabled
- **Battery life:** Less CPU usage = longer laptop battery
- **Future-proof:** Foundation for more performance optimizations

**Compatibility:**
- Works with existing timer text display (independent of animation)
- Fully backward compatible with all existing configs
- No changes needed to user settings (automatic on reload)

---

## 🎯 What's New in Version 7.4.2 (January 28, 2026)

### Major Performance Improvements
- **Much faster debuff tracking** - No more lag in 40-man raids
- **10x less memory usage** - Runs cleaner over long raid sessions
- **Instant cleanup** - Dead mobs cleaned up immediately (was: 2-5 minutes)

### Better Debuff Tracking
- **Multi-player debuffs** - See debuffs from all raid members with accurate timers
- **Rank protection** - Lower rank spells can't overwrite higher ranks anymore
- **100% accurate positioning** - Debuff icons always in the correct slot
- **Better combo points** - Rip, Rupture, Kidney Shot show correct duration

---

## 🎯 What's New in Version 7.4.1 (January 27, 2026)

### 🎯 Nameplate Debuff Timer Improvements

- ✅ **New Option: Enable Debuff Timers** - Toggle for debuff timer display on nameplates
  - Moved from hidden location (Appearance → Cooldown → "Display Debuff Durations") to Nameplates → Debuffs
  - All timer-related options are now grouped together for better discoverability
- ✅ **New Option: Show Timer Text** - Toggle the countdown text (e.g., "12s") on debuff icons
  - Previously always shown, now configurable
- ✅ **Show Timer Animation** - Existing pie-chart animation option, now properly grouped with other timer options

### 🖼️ Unitframe Timer Config Fix (unitframes.lua)

- ✅ **Live Config Updates** - "Show Timer Animation" and "Show Timer Text" now update immediately
  - Previously: Changes only applied after buffs/debuffs were refreshed
  - Now: Toggling the option instantly shows/hides the animation and text on existing buffs/debuffs

### 🔧 Slot Shifting Fix Attempt (libdebuff.lua)

- ✅ **DEBUFF_REMOVED now uses slotData.spellName** - Previously used spellName from scan, which could be wrong after slot shifting
  - When debuffs shift slots (e.g., slot 3 removed, slots 4+ shift down), the scan might read a different spell
  - Now uses `removedSpellName = slotData.spellName` from stored slot data for consistency
- ✅ **Cleanup empty spell tables** - After removing a caster from allAuraCasts, checks if no other casters remain and removes the empty spell table
- ✅ **Defensive casterGuid validation** - Checks for empty string and "0x0000000000000000" before looking up timer data
- ✅ **Invalid timer detection** - Warns when remaining > duration (impossible state)
- ✅ **ValidateSlotConsistency function** - Debug function to verify allSlots and allAuraCasts consistency after shifting
- ✅ **Enhanced debug logging** - All debug messages now include target= for easier filtering

---

## 🎯 What's New in Version 7.4.0 (January 26, 2026)

### 🗡️ Rogue Combo Point Fix

**PLAYER_COMBO_POINTS event now works for Rogues:**

The combo point tracking was previously only enabled for Druids. Rogues were completely ignored, causing abilities like Kidney Shot to always show base duration (1 sec) instead of the correct CP-scaled duration.

**Technical Details:**
- Nampower sends `durationMs=1000` (base duration) for Kidney Shot
- Code checked `if duration == 0` before calling `GetDuration()` 
- Since duration was 1 (not 0), the CP calculation was skipped
- Fix: Always call `GetDuration()` for CP-based abilities, regardless of event duration

### ⚙️ New Settings: Number & Timer Formatting

**Abbreviate Numbers (Settings → General):**

| Option | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Full Numbers | 4250 |
| 2 Decimals | 4.25k |
| 1 Decimal | 4.2k (always rounds DOWN) |

**Castbar Timer Decimals (Settings → General):**

| Option | Example |
|--------|---------|
| 1 Decimal | 2.1 |
| 2 Decimals | 2.14 |

### 🎬 Nameplate Castbar Improvements

**Smooth Castbar Animation:**
- Fixed stuttering castbar caused by incorrect throttle placement
- Scanner throttle (0.05s) now only affects nameplate detection
- Castbar updates run at full 50 FPS for smooth animation

**Countdown Timer:**
- Castbar timer now counts DOWN (3.0 → 0.0) instead of up
- Shows remaining cast time, not elapsed time

**Intelligent Throttling (unchanged):**
- Target OR casting nameplates: 0.02s (50 FPS)
- All other nameplates: 0.1s (10 FPS)
- Event updates bypass throttle entirely

### 🧹 Memory Management

**Cache cleanup for hidden nameplates:**
- `guidRegistry` cleared when plate hides
- `CastEvents` cleared when plate hides
- `debuffCache` cleared when plate hides
- `threatMemory` cleared when plate hides

Prevents memory leaks when mobs die or go out of range.

## 🎯 What's New in Version 7.3.0 (January 25, 2026)

### ⚡ O(1) Performance Optimizations for Unitframes

**Complete rewrite of health/mana lookups using Nampower's `GetUnitField` API:**

The unitframes now use direct memory access via `GetUnitField(guid, "health")` instead of the slower `UnitHealth()` API calls. This provides significant performance improvements especially in raids.

**Key Changes:**

| Component | Before (7.2.0) | After (7.3.0) |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| HealPredict Health | `UnitHealth()` API calls | `GetUnitField(guid, "health")` O(1) |
| Health Bar Colors | 4x redundant API calls per update | Uses cached `hp_orig`/`hpmax_orig` values |
| GetColor Function | `UnitHealth()` API calls | `GetUnitField(guid, "health")` O(1) |

**Fallback Support:**
- Automatic fallback to `UnitHealth()` when Nampower not available
- Automatic fallback for units >180 yards (out of Nampower range)
- Automatic fallback when GUID unavailable

### 🚀 Smart Roster Updates (No More Freeze!)

**GUID-based tracking eliminates screen freezes when swapping raid groups:**

Previously, any raid roster change would trigger a full update of ALL 40 raid frames, causing noticeable freezes. Now, only frames where the actual player changed get updated.

**How it works:**
```lua
-- OLD: RAID_ROSTER_UPDATE → ALL 40 frames update_full = true → FREEZE
-- NEW: RAID_ROSTER_UPDATE → Check GUID per frame → Only changed frames update
```

| Scenario | Before (7.2.0) | After (7.3.0) |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Swap 2 players | 40 frame updates | 2 frame updates |
| Player joins | 40 frame updates | 1 frame update |
| Player leaves | 40 frame updates | 1 frame update |
| No changes | 40 frame updates | 0 frame updates |

**Technical Implementation:**
- `pfUI.uf.guidTracker` tracks GUID per frame
- On roster change, compares old GUID vs new GUID
- Only sets `update_full = true` if GUID actually changed
- Also forces `update_aura = true` to refresh buffs/debuffs

### 🔧 libpredict.lua Optimizations

**Eliminated redundant `UnitName()` calls:**
- `UnitGetIncomingHeals()`: Removed double `UnitName()` call
- `UnitHasIncomingResurrection()`: Removed double `UnitName()` call  
- `UNIT_HEALTH` event handler: Reuses cached name variable

---

## 🎯 What's New in Version 7.2.0 (January 24, 2026)

### 🐱 Druid Secondary Mana Bar Overhaul

**Complete rewrite using Nampower's `GetUnitField` API:**

The Druid Mana Bar feature (showing base mana while in shapeshift form) has been completely rewritten to use Nampower's native `GetUnitField` instead of the deprecated `UnitMana()` extended return values.

**Key Changes:**

| Component | Before (7.1.0) | After (7.2.0) |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Data Source | `UnitMana()` second return value | `GetUnitField(guid, "power1")` |
| Player Support | ✅ Druids only | ✅ Druids only |
| Target Support | ❌ Limited/broken | ✅ All classes can see Druid mana in all forms |
| Text Settings | Hardcoded format | Respects Power Bar text config |

<img width="704" height="210" alt="grafik" src="https://i.ibb.co/bgfC04Gk/grafik.png" />

**New Features:**
- ✅ **Target Secondary Mana:** See enemy/friendly Druid's base mana while they're in Cat/Bear form
- ✅ **Respects Power Text Settings:** Uses same format as your Power Bar configuration (`powerdyn`, `power`, `powerperc`, `none`, etc.)
- ✅ **Available for ALL Classes:** Any class can now see Druid mana bars (controlled by "Show Druid Mana Bar" setting)

**Technical Implementation:**
```lua
-- OLD: Extended UnitMana (unreliable for other units)
local _, baseMana = UnitMana("target")  -- Often returns nil for non-player

-- NEW: Direct field access via Nampower
local _, guid = UnitExists("target")
local baseMana = GetUnitField(guid, "power1")      -- Base mana
local baseMaxMana = GetUnitField(guid, "maxPower1") -- Max base mana
```

### 🧹 Major Code Cleanup

**superwow.lua:**
- ❌ Removed legacy `pfDruidMana` bar (old SuperWoW-style implementation)
- ❌ Removed `UnitMana()` fallback code
- ✅ Unified all secondary mana bars to use `GetUnitField`
- ✅ Fixed text centering issue (was using `SetJustifyH("RIGHT")`)

**nampower.lua - Massive Cleanup:**

Removed significant amounts of dead/unused code:

| Removed Feature | Reason |
|-----------------|--------|
| Buff tracking system | Data collected but never displayed |
| HoT Detection (AURA_CAST events) | `OnHotApplied` callback never implemented |
| Swing Timer (`GetSwingTimers()`) | Never called anywhere in codebase |
| UNIT_DIED buff/debuff cleanup | Now handled by libdebuff |

**Result:** Cleaner, more maintainable code with reduced memory footprint.

### 🧹 Memory Leak Fixes

**libdebuff.lua:**
- ✅ `lastCastRanks` table now cleaned up (entries older than 3 seconds removed)
- ✅ `lastFailedSpells` table now cleaned up (entries older than 2 seconds removed)
- ✅ Previously these tables grew indefinitely over long play sessions

**unitframes.lua:**
- ✅ Cache cleanup now uses in-place `= nil` instead of creating new table every 30 seconds
- ✅ Reduces garbage collector pressure

**nameplates.lua:**
- ✅ Reusable `debuffSeen` table instead of creating `local seen = {}` on every DEBUFF_UPDATE event
- ✅ Significant reduction in table allocations during combat

---

## 🎯 What's New in Version 7.0.0 (January 21, 2026)

### 🔥 Complete libdebuff.lua Rewrite (464 → 1594 lines)

**Event-Driven Architecture:**

Replaced tooltip scanning with a pure event-based system using Nampower/SuperWoW:

**OLD (Master):**
```lua
-- Every UI update:
for slot = 1, 16 do
  scanner:SetUnitDebuff("target", slot)  -- Tooltip scan
  local name = scanner:Line(1)
end
```

**NEW (Experiment):**
```lua
-- Events fire when changes happen:
RegisterEvent("AURA_CAST_ON_SELF")     -- You cast a debuff
RegisterEvent("DEBUFF_ADDED_OTHER")    -- Debuff lands in slot
RegisterEvent("DEBUFF_REMOVED_OTHER")  -- Debuff removed

-- UI reads from pre-computed tables:
local data = ownDebuffs[guid][spell]  -- Direct lookup
```

---

### 🐱 Combo Point Finisher Support

**Dynamic Duration Calculation:**

| Ability | Formula | Durations (1-5 CP) |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Rip | 8s + CP × 2s | 10s / 12s / 14s / 16s / 18s |
| Rupture | 10s + CP × 2s | 12s / 14s / 16s / 18s / 20s |
| Kidney Shot | 2s + CP × 1s | 3s / 4s / 5s / 6s / 7s |

**Before:** All Rips showed 18s (wrong for 1-4 CP)
**After:** Shows actual duration based on combo points used

---

### 🎭 Carnage Talent Detection

**Ferocious Bite Refresh Mechanics:**
- Tracks Carnage talent (Rank 2) which makes Ferocious Bite refresh Rip & Rake
- Only refreshes when Ferocious Bite HITS (not on miss/dodge/parry)
- Preserves original duration (doesn't reset to new CP count)
- Uses `DidSpellFail()` API for miss detection

---

### 🔄 Additional Features

- **Debuff Overwrite Pairs:** Faerie Fire ↔ Faerie Fire (Feral), Demoralizing Shout ↔ Demoralizing Roar
- **Slot Shifting Algorithm:** Accurate icon placement when debuffs expire
- **Multi-Caster Tracking:** Multiple players' debuffs tracked separately
- **Rank Protection:** Lower rank can't overwrite higher rank timer
- **Unique Debuff System:** Hunter's Mark, Scorpid Sting, etc. handled correctly

---

## 📊 Performance Comparison

### The Core Difference: Data Access Architecture

**Master uses Blizzard API + Tooltip Scanning:**
```lua
-- Every UnitDebuff call requires tooltip scan
function libdebuff:UnitDebuff(unit, id)
  local texture, stacks, dtype = UnitDebuff(unit, id)
  if texture then
    scanner:SetUnitDebuff(unit, id)  -- Tooltip scan to get spell name
    effect = scanner:Line(1)
  end
  -- Duration comes from hardcoded lookup tables
end

-- UnitOwnDebuff iterates all 16 slots
function libdebuff:UnitOwnDebuff(unit, id)
  for i = 1, 16 do
    local effect = libdebuff:UnitDebuff(unit, i)  -- 16 tooltip scans!
    if caster == "player" then ...
  end
end
```

**Experiment uses Nampower Events + GetUnitField:**
```lua
-- Single call returns ALL 48 aura slots (32 buffs + 16 debuffs)
local auras = GetUnitField(guid, "aura")  -- Returns array[48] of spell IDs
local stacks = GetUnitField(guid, "auraApplications")  -- Returns array[48] of stack counts

-- Events fire with full data including duration
-- AURA_CAST_ON_OTHER: spellId, casterGuid, targetGuid, effect, effectAuraName, 
--                     effectAmplitude, effectMiscValue, durationMs, auraCapStatus
-- BUFF_REMOVED_OTHER: guid, slot, spellId, stackCount, auraLevel

-- UnitOwnDebuff is just a table lookup
function libdebuff:UnitOwnDebuff(unit, id)
  local _, guid = UnitExists(unit)
  local data = ownDebuffs[guid][spellName]  -- Pre-computed by events
  return data.duration, data.timeleft, ...
end
```

### Nampower Features Used (Experiment Only)

| Feature | Purpose | Data Provided |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| `GetUnitField(guid, "aura")` | Single call returns all 48 aura spell IDs | `array[48]` of spell IDs |
| `GetUnitField(guid, "auraApplications")` | Stack counts for all auras | `array[48]` of stack counts |
| `GetUnitField(guid, "power1")` | Base mana for shapeshifted Druids | Mana value (7.2.0) |
| `GetUnitField(guid, "maxPower1")` | Max base mana | Max mana value (7.2.0) |
| `AURA_CAST_ON_OTHER` | Instant debuff cast detection | spellId, casterGuid, targetGuid, **durationMs** |
| `AURA_CAST_ON_SELF` | Instant self-buff detection | Same as above |
| `BUFF_REMOVED_OTHER` | Instant aura removal detection | guid, **slot**, spellId, stackCount |
| `DEBUFF_ADDED_OTHER` | Debuff slot assignment | guid, slot, spellId, stacks |
| `DEBUFF_REMOVED_OTHER` | Debuff removal with slot info | guid, slot, spellId |

Master uses **none** of these - it relies on:
- `UnitDebuff()` API (no caster info, no duration)
- Tooltip scanning via `GameTooltip:SetUnitDebuff()` to get spell names
- Chat message parsing (`CHAT_MSG_SPELL_PERIODIC_*`) for duration detection
- Hardcoded duration lookup tables

### Performance Comparison

| Operation | Master | Experiment | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Initial target scan | 16 tooltip scans | 1 GetUnitField call (48 slots) | **16x fewer calls** |
| Get YOUR debuffs | Loop 16 slots + tooltip each | Direct table lookup | **~50-100x faster** |
| Debuff duration | Hardcoded tables / chat parsing | Event provides `durationMs` | **Accurate to ms** |
| Detect debuff removal | Polling / timeout | `BUFF_REMOVED_OTHER` event | **Instant** |
| Detect new debuff | Chat message delay | `AURA_CAST_ON_OTHER` event | **Instant** |
| Caster identification | Not available | Event provides `casterGuid` | **New capability** |
| Druid mana (other units) | Not available | `GetUnitField(guid, "power1")` | **New in 7.2.0** |
| Memory usage | ~50KB | ~200KB | 4x more (negligible) |

### Memory Management (7.1.0+ Fixes)

| Table | Before 7.1.0 | After 7.1.0 |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| `lastCastRanks` | Grew indefinitely | Cleaned every 30s (>3s old) |
| `lastFailedSpells` | Grew indefinitely | Cleaned every 30s (>2s old) |
| `debuffSeen` (nameplates) | New table per DEBUFF_UPDATE | Reused single table |
| `cleanedCache` (unitframes) | New table every 30s | In-place cleanup |

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Untested Scenarios

- ❌ 40-man raids with 5+ druids (slot shifting stress test)
- ❌ Rapid target swapping with Ferocious Bite spam
- ⚠️ Multi-caster tracking in AQ40/Naxx

### Edge Cases

1. **DEBUFF_ADDED race condition:** Sometimes fires before AURA_CAST_ON_SELF processes
2. **Slot shifting bugs:** Complex logic for removing/adding debuffs
3. **Combo point detection:** Relies on PLAYER_COMBO_POINTS event timing

- debuff tracking on enemys (for your own abilitys/spells) should be working properly too now

---

## What's New in Version 6.2.2 (January 10, 2026)

### 🎯 Failed Spell Detection (libdebuff.lua)

- ✅ **Resist/Miss/Dodge/Parry Detection** - Spells that fail to land no longer create or update timers
  - Detects: Miss, Resist, Dodge, Parry, Evade, Deflect, Reflect, Block, Absorb, Immune
  - Timer is either blocked before creation or reverted if fail event arrives late
- ✅ **Public API: `libdebuff:DidSpellFail(spell)`** - Other modules can check if a spell recently failed
  - Returns true if spell failed within the last 1 second
  - Used by turtle-wow.lua for refresh mechanics

### 🐱 Druid/Warlock Refresh Fixes (turtle-wow.lua)

- ✅ **Ferocious Bite Refresh Fix** - Rip/Rake timers only refresh when Ferocious Bite actually hits
  - Previously: Timer refreshed even on dodge/parry/miss
  - Now: Uses `DidSpellFail()` to verify hit before refreshing
- ✅ **Conflagrate Refresh Fix** - Immolate duration only reduced when Conflagrate actually hits
- ✅ **Caster Inheritance** - Refresh mechanics preserve existing caster info when not explicitly provided

### ⚡ SuperWoW Compatibility (superwow.lua)

- ✅ **Removed UNIT_CASTEVENT for DoT Timers** - SuperWoW's instant event fires before resist/miss detection
  - DoT timers now use standard hook-based fallback (compatible with resist detection)
  - HoT timers (Rejuvenation, Renew, etc.) still use SuperWoW for instant detection (buffs can't be resisted)

---

## What's New in Version 6.2.1 (January 10, 2026)

### 🎯 Debuff Timer Protection System (libdebuff.lua)

- ✅ **Spell Rank Tracking** - Tracks spell rank for all your DoTs/debuffs
  - Uses `lastCastRanks` table to preserve rank information across multiple event sources
  - Fixes race condition where SuperWoW UNIT_CASTEVENT fired before QueueFunction processed pending data
- ✅ **Lower Rank Protection** - Lower rank spells cannot overwrite higher rank timers
  - Example: If Moonfire Rank 10 is active, casting Rank 5 will be blocked
- ✅ **Other Player Protection** - Other players' casts cannot overwrite your debuff timers
  - Your DoTs are tracked separately from other players' DoTs
  - Multiple players can have their own Moonfire/Corruption on the same target
- ✅ **Shared Debuff Whitelist** - Debuffs that are shared by all players update correctly:
  - Warrior: Sunder Armor, Demoralizing Shout, Thunder Clap
  - Rogue: Expose Armor
  - Druid: Faerie Fire, Faerie Fire (Feral)
  - Hunter: Hunter's Mark
  - Warlock: Curse of Weakness/Recklessness/Elements/Shadow/Tongues/Exhaustion
  - Priest: Shadow Weaving
  - Mage: Winter's Chill
  - Paladin: All Judgements

## What's New in Version 6.2.0 (January 10, 2026)

### 🔮 HoT Timer System (libpredict.lua)

- ✅ **Regrowth Duration Fix** - Corrected duration from 21 to 20 seconds (matching actual Turtle WoW spell duration)
- ✅ **GetTime() Synchronization** - All timing calls now use `pfUI.uf.now or GetTime()` for consistent timing across all UI elements
- ✅ **Instant-HoT Detection Fix** - Fixed Rejuvenation/Renew not being detected when cast quickly after Regrowth
  - Problem: `spell_queue` was overwritten before processing
  - Solution: Instant HoTs now processed immediately at cast hooks with `current_cast` tracking
- ✅ **SuperWoW UNIT_CASTEVENT Support** - Precise Instant-HoT detection using UNIT_CASTEVENT
  - Only fires on successful casts (not attempts), eliminating false triggers from GCD/range failures
  - Graceful fallback to hook-based detection for players without SuperWoW
- ✅ **HealComm Compatibility** - Full compatibility with standalone HealComm addon users
  - 0.3s delay compensation for Regrowth messages
  - Duplicate detection (0.5s window) prevents double timers
- ✅ **PARTY Channel Support** - HoT messages now sent to PARTY channel for 5-man dungeons

### 🎯 Nameplate Improvements (nameplates.lua)

- ✅ **Target Castbar Zoom Fix** - Fixed current target castbar not showing when zoom factor is enabled
  - Multi-method target detection: alpha check, `istarget` flag, and `zoomed` state
  - Proper GUID lookup for target castbar info (was incorrectly using string "target")
- ✅ **Flicker/Vibration Fix** - Eliminated nameplate flicker near zoom boundaries
  - Alpha check changed from `== 1` to `>= 0.99` (floating-point fix)
  - Zoom tolerance changed from `>= w` to `> w + 0.5` (prevents oscillation)
- ✅ **libdebuff Nil-Checks** - Added safety checks to prevent errors when libdebuff data is unavailable

### ⚡ Spell Queue (nampower.lua)

- ✅ **Error Handling** - Added pcall wrapper for `GetSpellNameAndRankForId` to prevent error spam when spell ID not found

### 🐱 Druid Improvements

- ✅ **Rip Duration** (libdebuff.lua) - Now dynamically calculated based on combo points (10/12/14/16/18 seconds for 1-5 CP)
- ✅ **Ferocious Bite Refresh** (turtle-wow.lua) - Now refreshes both Rip AND Rake (previously only Rip), preserving existing duration

### ⚡ Energy Tick (energytick.lua)

- ✅ **Talent/Buff Energy Filter** - Ignores energy gains from talents/buffs (e.g., Ancient Brutality and Tiger's Fury) to prevent tick timer reset from non-natural energy gains

---

## What's New in Version 6.1.1 (January 8, 2026)

- ✅ **SuperWoW nil-check** - Added nil-check for `SpellInfo` in superwow.lua to prevent errors when SuperWoW is not installed
- ✅ **Missing Event Registration** - Added missing events for raid/party frames: `PARTY_MEMBER_ENABLE`, `PARTY_MEMBER_DISABLE`, `PLAYER_UPDATE_RESTING`

### 🎨 UI Improvements

- ✅ **Share Button Warning** - Shows message when Share module is disabled instead of doing nothing
- ✅ **Hoverbind Button Warning** - Shows message when Hoverbind module is disabled instead of doing nothing

---

## What's New in Version 6.0.0 (January 5, 2026)

### 🚀 Major Performance Improvements

- ✅ **Central Raid/Party Event Handler** - Replaced per-frame event registration with a centralized system using O(1) unitmap lookups instead of O(n) iteration. Reduces event processing from ~5,760 calls/sec to ~400 calls/sec in 40-man raids (97.5% improvement)
- ✅ **Raid HP/Mana Update Fix** - Fixed race condition where unitmap wasn't rebuilt after frame IDs were reassigned, causing HP/Mana bars to not update when players swap positions
- ✅ **OnUpdate Throttling** - Added configurable throttles to reduce CPU usage:
  - Nameplates: 0.1s throttle (target updates remain instant)
  - Tooltip cursor following: 0.1s throttle
  - Chat tab mouseover: 0.1s throttle
  - Panel alignment: 0.2s throttle
  - Autohide hover check: 0.05s throttle
  - Libpredict cleanup: 0.1s throttle

### 🔧 Castbar & Pushback System

- ✅ **Pushback Fix** - Fixed spell pushback calculation: now correctly adds delay to `casttime` instead of `start` time, matching actual WoW behavior
- ✅ **Player GUID Caching** - Caches player GUID on PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD for efficient self-cast detection
- ✅ **Hybrid Detection System** - Uses libcast.db for player casts (handles SPELLCAST_DELAYED events) and SuperWoW's UNIT_CASTEVENT for NPC/other player casts
- ✅ **2-Decimal Precision** - Castbar timer now displays with 2 decimal places (e.g., "1.45 / 2.50") for more precise timing

### 🐱 Druid Stealth Detection

- ✅ **Event-Based Detection** - Replaced polling-based stealth detection with event-driven system using UNIT_CASTEVENT and PLAYER_AURAS_CHANGED
- ✅ **Instant Cat Form Detection** - Detects Cat Form via UNIT_CASTEVENT (spell ID 768) for immediate actionbar page switch
- ✅ **Smart Buff Scanning** - Only scans buffs when actually needed (entering Cat Form), eliminates 31-buff scan every frame
- ✅ **Cached Variables** - Caches stealth state to prevent redundant checks

### 🎯 Nameplate Improvements

- ✅ **Friendly Player Classification** - Fixed friendly players being classified as FRIENDLY_NPC, now correctly uses FRIENDLY_PLAYER for proper nameplate coloring and behavior

## FAQ
**What does "pfUI" stand for?**  
The term "*pfui!*" is german and simply stands for "*pooh!*", because I'm not a
big fan of creating configuration UI's, especially not via the Wow-API
(you might have noticed that in ShaguUI).

**How can I donate?**  
You can donate via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/shagu) or [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/shagu)

**How do I report a Bug?**  
Please provide as much information as possible in the [Bugtracker](https://github.com/me0wg4ming/pfUI/issues).
If there is an error message, provide the full content of it. Just telling that "there is an error" won't help any of us.
Please consider adding additional information such as: since when did you got the error,
does it still happen using a clean configuration, what other addons are loaded and which version you're running.
When playing with a non-english client, the language might be relevant too. If possible, explain how people can reproduce the issue.

**How can I contribute?**
Report errors and issues in the [Bugtracker](https://github.com/me0wg4ming/pfUI/issues).
Please make sure to have the latest version installed and check for conflicting addons beforehand.

**I have bad performance, what can I do?**  
Version 6.0.0 includes significant performance optimizations. If you still experience issues:
1. Disable "Frame Shadows" in Settings → Appearance → Enable Frame Shadows
2. Check `/pfdll` to see which DLLs are active (some features require DLLs)
3. Disable all AddOns but pfUI and enable one-by-one to identify conflicts
4. Report issues via the [Bugtracker](https://github.com/me0wg4ming/pfUI/issues)

**Where is the happiness indicator for pets?**  
The pet happiness is shown as the color of your pet's frame. Depending on your skin, this can either be the text or the background color of your pet's healthbar:

- Green = Happy
- Yellow = Content
- Red = Unhappy

Since version 4.0.7 there is also an additional icon that can be enabled from the pet unit frame options.

**Can I use Clique with pfUI?**  
This addon already includes support for clickcasting. If you still want to make use of clique, all pfUI's unitframes are already compatible to Clique-TBC. For Vanilla, a pfUI compatible version can be found [Here](https://github.com/shagu/Clique/archive/master.zip). If you want to keep your current version of Clique, you'll have to apply this [Patch](https://github.com/shagu/Clique/commit/a5ee56c3f803afbdda07bae9cd330e0d4a75d75a).

**Where is the Experience Bar?**  
The experience bar shows up on mouseover and whenever you gain experience, next to left chatframe by default. There's also an option to make it stay visible all the time.

**How do I show the Damage- and Threatmeter Dock?**  
If you enabled the "dock"-feature for your external (third-party) meters such as DPSMate or KTM, then you'll be able to toggle between them and the Right Chat by clicking on the ">" symbol on the bottom-right panel.

**Why is my chat always resetting to only 3 lines of text?**  
This happens if "Simple Chat" is enabled in blizzards interface settings (Advanced Options).
Paste the following command into your chat to disable that option: `/run SIMPLE_CHAT="0"; pfUI.chat.SetupPositions(); ReloadUI()`

**How can I enable mouseover cast?**  
On Vanilla, create a macro with "/pfcast SPELLNAME". If you also want to see the cooldown, You might want to add "/run if nil then CastSpellByName("SPELLNAME") end" on top of the macro.

**Everything from scratch?! Are you insane?**  
Most probably, yes.
